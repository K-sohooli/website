## **Last semester: Diving into the World of Causal Inference and Virtual Machines** ##

During the previous semester at Tilburg Science Hub, we were immersed in a dynamic period of learning, exploration, and innovation. We've been busy developing content that we're excited to share with you. Especially, we've immersed ourselves in the field of causal inference and also delved into the world of virtual machines. Let's take a closer look at the resources we've created in these two areas.

### **Causal Inference**

Causal inference lies at the core of our exploration, and we've assembled a comprehensive set of resources to guide you through this complex yet captivating domain:

- [Intro to IV Estimation](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/iv/): Begin your journey into causal inference with a thorough introduction to IV (Instrumental Variable) estimation, a fundamental concept in this field.

- [Doing Calculations with Regression Coefficients Using deltaMethod](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/deltamethod/): Master the art of handling regression coefficients with precision through the deltaMethod, a crucial technique for robust causal inference.

- [https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/impact-evaluation/](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/impact-evaluation/): Explore the world of impact evaluation through regressions, uncovering how interventions and policies can be rigorously analyzed to make informed decisions.

- [https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/synth-control/](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/synth-control/): Discover the power of the Synthetic Control Method, an invaluable tool for causal inference in diverse research scenarios.

- [Fixed-Effects Estimation in R with the fixest Package](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/analyze-data/regressions/fixest/): Enhance your analytical toolkit by gaining expertise in fixed-effects estimation using the fixest package in R, particularly useful for panel data analyses.


### **Virtual Machines**

In addition to our deep dive into causal inference, we've ventured into the world of virtual machines (VMs). These resources are designed to empower you to use virtual computing environments to their full potential:

- [Configure a VM with GPUs in Google Cloud](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/automate-and-execute-your-work/reproducible-work/config-vm-gcp/): Learn how to use the computing power of GPUs on Google Cloud by setting up a customized VM to meet your research requirements.

- [Import and run a Python environment on Google cloud with Docker](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/automate-and-execute-your-work/reproducible-work/google_cloud_docker/): Explore the world of containerization and Docker to import and run Python environments on Google Cloud, enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of your work.

- [Export a Python environment with Docker and share it through Docker Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/automate-and-execute-your-work/reproducible-work/dockerhub/): Learn to export Python environments with Docker and streamline collaboration by sharing them on Docker Hub, ensuring easy access for fellow researchers.


### **Empowering Your Research Journey in Causal Inference and Virtual Machines**
Our aim is to support your exploration of causal inference and virtual machines. These resources are designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to excel in your research. We encourage you to delve in, learn, and innovate alongside us as we push the boundaries of science and data analysis together.
