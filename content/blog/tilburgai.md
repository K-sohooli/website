# **Introducting Tilburg.ai**

In a rapidly changing educational landscape influenced by AI, we're thrilled to share our latest project with you – [the Tilburg.ai website](https//tilburg.ai)! Over the past few weeks, a passionate group of AI enthusiasts from Tilburg Science Hub have been working behind the scenes on this new website.
 
## **Exploring the Possibilities**

We started by asking a simple but profound question: How can AI enhance education? At Tilburg.ai, we want to answer this question. Here, you can explore innovative ways to integrate AI into the classroom and stay updated on the evolving needs of educators and learners.
 

## **The Minds Behind Tilburg.ai**

Tilburg.ai is currently curated by the "AI in education" working group, led by TiSEM's Vice Dean of Education, and supported by two student assistants of Tilburg Science Hub, Jonas and Matthijs. The coordination is overseen by Associate Professor Hannes Datta, who is also a member of the Tilburg Science Hub team. They are a team of passionate individuals bridging the gap between AI and education.
 

## **Navigating AI in Education: Insights for Students and Faculty**

The website covers all different kinds of blogs highlighting tutorials and use cases for effectively using ChatGPT and other AI tools in education. We provide insights from both the student and teaching faculty perspectives. Take a look at [our site](https://tilburg.ai) to discover information about AI, ChatGPT and helpful tools for you!  


## **Contribute yourself!**

But here's the thing – this is just the beginning, and we want YOU to be a part of it! We're on a journey of continuous development and expansion of our content, and we're inviting you to make a contribution.
