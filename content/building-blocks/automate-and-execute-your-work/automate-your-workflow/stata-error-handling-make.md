## Learning Goals

- Learn how to use R to monitor and handle errors in Stata log files.
- Incorporate error-checking scripts into automated workflows, such as a Makefile.

## Overview

When you run Stata within an automated research pipeline (e.g., using a `makefile`), Stata does not stop the progression of the `makefile`, even if there is an error in your code!. As a result, you won't know if the Stata code executed without errors unless you check the Stata log files.

To remedy this issue, you can use R to check for any error that may have occurred in the log file. If there was an error, we can make the workflow to interrupt.

## Code

We will show you how to simply check the Stata log files for errors and stop the `makefile` if there are any errors.

- **Pre-requisites**:

	- Ensure you have installed [Make](/get/make), [Stata](/get/stata) and [R](/get/r/).
	- Confirm that your Stata do-file is set up to generate a log file. This log file will be the primary source for error detection.
	- Create an R script called `logcheck.R` that checks for errors and the completion of the do-file from the log file.

It's crucial to add these software installations to your environment variable named "PATH" to ensure seamless integration. If you're unfamiliar with adding tools to the PATH, here's a [helpful resource](https://github.com/alexal1/Insomniac/wiki/Adding-platform-tools-to-the-PATH-environment-variable).

### Create an R script that checks for errors and completion of the do-file

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
# Define the arguments
args = commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)

# Test if there is at least one argument: if not, return an error
if (length(args)==0) {
  stop("At least one argument must be supplied (input file).n", call.=FALSE)
}

# Read the log file
filecontent = readLines(args)

# Check if the log file includes an error massage and if so stop and display an error message
if (any(grepl('^r[(][0-9]',filecontent,ignore.case=T))) {
 stop(paste0('Log file for ', args, ' contains errors!'))
}
# Check whether the do-file was executed completely
if (!any(grepl('(end of do-file)',filecontent,ignore.case=T))) {

  stop(paste0('File (', args, ') has not been processed entirely!'))
}
# If no errors, report that there are no errors.
cat(paste0('Log file for ', args, ' checked. No errors.'))
```

### Incorporate the check in the Makefile
Here, you can replicate any rule where you run a do-file which creates a log file. We just use some random rule:

{{% codeblock %}}

```bash
# Define a rule where you use a do-file
target_file: prerequisite.do # define your target and prerequisites
	rm prerequisite.log # remove older log file produced by prerequisite.do previously
	StataMP-64.exe -e do prerequisite.do # execute the do-file
	Rscript logcheck.R prerequisite.log # check the log file for errors or incompletion
```
