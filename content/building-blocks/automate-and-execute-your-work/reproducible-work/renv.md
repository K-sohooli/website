## Learning Goals

- Understand the purpose, features, and setup of `renv` for R project package management.
- Get introduced to other R dependency tools.

## Environment management for R projects with renv

`renv` is a dependency management tool for R projects, facilitating the reproducibility of environments across computers or platforms.
As a package management tool, `renv` helps to make projects: 
- **Isolated** : installing or updating a certain package in one project doesn't affect other packages from other projects.
- **Portable** : projects can easily be transferred to different devices.
- **Reproducible** : `renv` makes it easy to reproduce projects by recording all package versions of each project.


## Workflow

### 1. Install `renv`
First thing we need to do is to install the `renv` package.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
install.packages("renv")

```

{{% /codeblock %}}


### 2. Initialize new project environment
Then we can move to initializing the local environment of the project. We can do that with the following command:

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
renv::init() 

```
{{% /codeblock %}}

### 3. Install/remove packages
After initializing the project, we can install or remove packages from it:

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
#install packages
install.packages()
#or
renv::install()

#remove packages
remove.packages()
#or
renv::remove()

```
{{% /codeblock %}}

### 4. Save library of project in `lockfile`
After configuring the project, we should save the configuration into a `lockfile`, in which all packages versions are recorded. 

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
renv::snapshot()

```
{{% /codeblock %}}

We can also check the status of the library with:
{{% codeblock %}}
```R
renv::status()

```
{{% /codeblock %}}


If we continue to make changes to the packages after making the `lockfile`, but then we would like revert to the previous state (as recorded in the `lockfile`), we can use:

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
renv::restore()

```
{{% /codeblock %}}

### Directory overview

After running all the commands above, the directory in which the project was created should contain the following files:

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../img/directory.png" width="400">
<figcaption> Our project would look like this</figcaption>
</p>


| File               | Usage                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `.Rprofile`        | File that activates renv for the new R sessions        |
| `renv.lock`        | The created lockfile containing all packages and versions |
| `renv/activate.R`  | Activation script run by `.Rprofile`                   |
| `renv/library`     | Private project library                                |
| `renv/settings.json`| Project settings

**Another Project in Rstudio?**

When creating a new project in RStudio, you have the option to directly integrate `renv`.

<p align = "center">
<img src = "../img/use-renv.png" width="500">
<figcaption> Select the checkbox to intregate renv</figcaption>
</p>

To ensure `renv` is part of your project environment, simply select the *"Use renv with this project"* checkbox. This way, RStudio will automatically configure the necessary settings for `renv`. 

Given this automatic setup, **you can skip step 1** from the workflow mentioned above.

## Alternative R Dependency Management Options

The R community offers multiple tools to manage dependencies and reproducibility. While `renv` stands out due to its features, other tools have historically been used or still offer specific features that might be appealing to some users.

### Packrat

[Packrat](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/automate-and-execute-your-work/reproducible-work/packrat/) is an earlier solution for managing project-specific R libraries. It helps isolate projects and make them more reproducible by ensuring that each project's library is separate. 

Nonetheless, while `packrat` was widely used, it has some limitations which `renv` has aimed to address. Furthermore, while it is still maintained, there will be no new development for it. This presents `renv` as a better alternative.

**From Packrat to Renv**

 To switch from `packrat` to `renv`, use `renv::migrate()` to migrate projects.

### Groundhog

`groundhog` is another R package that facilitates project reproducibility. Unlike `renv` which maintains records of package versions specific to each project, `groundhog` requires users to manually load libraries by specifying a date to fetch the version available at that time.

This can be challenging, as users have to recall the specific dates when certain versions were available. On the other hand, `renv` conveniently loads all necessary packages in one go, making the overall process smoother.
