## Overview

When using [Scrum](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/learn/scrum) and [GitHub Project Boards](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/use/projectboard) to manage work on projects, it's easy to overlook the importance of preparing and following-up on meetings. To ensure your meetings are as effective as possible, here's a comprehensive set of tips to follow, divided in the following three sections:
- Prepare for the meeting
- Conducting the meeting
- Post-meeting follow-up


### Prepare for the meeting

- Ensure that all the issues that are completed are moved to the “Done” section.
- If you have a follow-up question/task on an issue you have moved to “Done”, add comments to provide clarity. Click on the issue and then select “Go to issue for full details” in the right column of your screen.

- Close any issues that have no further follow-up questions. Do not archive the issue, yet!
- Make sure that you know the status of all the issues you have moved to the “In Progress” section.

### Conducting the meeting

  - The issues that are set to “Done” should be discussed first.
  - Then discuss the issues set to “In Progress” and “To Do”. Make a quick note of any relevant tasks that are discussed during the meeting in the “Backlog” section. You will revise these quick notes after the meeting.
  - Together with your team, discuss which issues from the "Backlog" should be worked on in the upcoming sprint.

### Post-meeting follow-up

  - Move all the issues that are set to “Done” and require further discussion to be done. Make sure you add notes that specify the follow-up tasks you need to complete.
  - Archive "Done" issues that are fully complete and require no more attention. 
  - Transform the quick notes taken during the meeting into issues. 

  Link the associated repository to the issue and be thorough in renaming the issues. If needed, break the note down into smaller issues. You could also categorize all your issues with labels to better manage the project.
  - Move the issues slated for the upcoming sprint into the “To Do” section. This includes both follow-up actions and new items from the "Backlog".
  - Prioritize the issues within the "To Do" section by dragging them up or down the list.
