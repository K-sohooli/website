## Overview

`Forest plots` are a visual representation of findings from various scientific studies that investigate a common research question. They find significant application in the field of `meta-analysis`, a type of statistical analysis that combines and examines results from a number of independent studies. 
More practically, forest plots identify a statistic that is common to such set of studies and report the various instances of that statistic. This, in turn, allows to compare the different results and the significance of the overall pooled summary effect. <br/>
<br/>
Among the **benefits** of forest plots, we find:

* clear and concise `visual representation` of results;
* `effect size` and `confidence interval` comparison across different studies;
* overall, useful tool to evaluate the consistency and strength of evidence, identify potential sources of bias, 
  and make informed judgments about the effect of interventions or exposures.
