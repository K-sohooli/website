## Overview

When writing a thesis, a paper, or simply performing a market research, surveys are among the most used and reliable alternatives to using existing datasets.

<br/>

Among the `advantages` of surveys are:
* the possibility to target a specific niche;
* tailor it to your exact research needs;
* generate data (otherwise non-existent) on novel research ideas.

In terms of `drawbacks`:
* really often not generalisable to the whole population due to biases that might affect the data generated;
* difficult to optimally design questions to avoid errors;
* good surveys require a lot of work and might still be less rigorous than existing datasets.

Talk about how one can work around the limitations and use it as an introduction to how important it is to use a software that, first, allows to run professional and well structured surveys, and, second, allows for an optimal data analysis once the responses are collected. 

### Design your own survey
