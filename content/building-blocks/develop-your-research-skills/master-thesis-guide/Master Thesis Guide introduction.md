## Introduction

Welcome to the Master Thesis Guide, a comprehensive resource primarily for Master's students in the quantitative social sciences, while also beneficial for Bachelor students or Ph.D. candidates. Think of studies within departments such as economics, data science, marketing analytics, and management.

In this guide, lots of relevant resources are bundled from Tilburg Science Hub and beyond, providing a thorough approach to thesis writing. While serving as a valuable companion at every stage of the research process, it is essential to refer to the official guidelines provided by your department. 


The guide is organized into the following sections: 

1. [Preparation](/masterthesisguide/preparation): Setting the groundwork for your research process.
2. [Coding, Workflow, and Data Management](/masterthesisguide/datacoding): The core foundation of your research methodology.
3. [Writing](/masterthesisguide/writing): Guidance for good academic writing and thesis formatting.
4. [Thesis outline](/masterthesisguide/outline): Chapter-specific insights: from the Introduction to Discussion and Conclusion.
