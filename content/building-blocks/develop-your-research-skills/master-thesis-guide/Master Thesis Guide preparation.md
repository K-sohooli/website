## Overview

The Master Thesis Guide will serve as a guidance throughout the whole writing process of a thesis that consists of an empirical research project, for studies in marketing, economics, management, etc. This page covers the **Preparation** phase of your thesis process. The following sections are included:
- The research question
- The research proposal
- Invest in skills beforehand

## The research question

Whether you are in the process of finding a subject or you are already writing your thesis proposal, refining your research question is crucial work. Starting early on this is key as it takes time to narrow down and revise your topic.

A good research question:
- addresses a real-world problem, contributing to existing research in your field
- is personally interesting, and you can imagine yourself spending time exploring it in the next months

### How to come up with a good research question?

#### Using Academic journals

Academic journals are a crucial resource in shaping your research question.

- Begin by examining (recently published) academic journals within your field. The table of contents might already give you a good overview on "hot topics" and emerging trends. 

- When you have identified relevant articles for your topic, browse through their reference lists to follow these references and discover other relevant papers. This is called **backward reference searching**.

- Also **forward reference searching** is useful, where you identify articles that cite the article you have in hands. This will help you find new developments on your topic. 

- As you begin to form an idea about the direction of your subject, review relevant papers in more depth. Read the introduction to see the research question from the author's perspective. Pay extra attention to their suggestions for "future research" (mostly found in the end of the paper), these might give you good ideas for your research!

#### Other sources of inspiration

To shape your research topic, it is a good order to go outside and start from a "real world" issue. Don't limit yourself by staying in your field and go beyond academic journals. Think outside the box. Some ideas are:

- Engage with the the **business community** by reading corporate blogs, white papers, and content on platforms like LinkedIn to connect with real-world issues and industry perspectives. 
- Read **news sites** to remain informed about recent developments. 
- Talk to **colleagues and friends**, also the ones that are not in your field. Their input can offer you a good insight whether your topic is something relevant in real-life scenarios. 
- Read **practioner journals** like the Harvard Business Review and insights from policy makers (e.g. European Commission), scientific research institutes and specific industry-focused organization. 

For example, the [Marketing science institute](https://www.msi.org/) publishes a lists of the important research topics regularly, e.g. [the list of 2022-2024 research priorities](https://www.msi.org/article/msi-announces-2022-24-research-priorities/). 

- Reflect on your own experience! Did you encounter a question somewhere in your studies that interested you and left you with a sense of curiosity to potential solutions?

By blending insights from academic journals with real-world observations and diverse perspectives, you can come up with an impactful research question for your thesis.

Take notes from every interesting resource you encounter and avoid losing good resources for later in the process. Be consistent and note down at least the author(s), title, and URL.

### Contribution to existing research

When you've identified a relevant topic, it is crucial to articulate how your research contributes to existing knowledge. Ways in how to state the importance of your contribution are:

- **Testing assumptions on which existing research relies:** Test their validity through empirical research, potentially leading to modifications of existing theories.

- **Probing external validity**: Evaluate the generalizability of findings to different contexts. For example, will these results hold with different background factors, like different time periods, countries, or other common background factors?

- **Exploring new domains of inquiry**: Investigate unexplored topics that have the potential to significantly impact the field if if it was better understood.

- **Working backward in the causal chain**: Examine a crucial variable, that by being understood better, can potentially lead to shed light on fundamental relationships underlying observed phenonema. 

- **Intervene in an accepted causal chain**: Reconsider existing assumptions or relationships in your field. What happens if they disappear? 

- **Challenging conventional managerial practices**: Identify gaps in management practices, offering an alternative perspective that can lead to better managerial decision-making processes.

- **Resolving inconsistent findings**: Revisit contradictory research findings by critically evaluating the methodologies, contexts, and variables involved. 

- **Examining research holistically**: Analyze existing research in a comprehensive manner, create a deeper understanding of research that is already there.

**The three-question pitch**
Formulate a convincing pitch about your research question by summarizing your answers to the following questions:

1. What's new about it? E.g. new data, new variables, new method?
2. Is it useful? And to whom? 
Formulate potential outcomes to specific stakeholders, can they implement your findings? E.g. policymakers or managers. Keep it realistic: don't overstate your contribution and make a realistic assessment about how your study will affect different stakeholders.
3. Is it interesting? 
If it is an already known fact, it is not interesting. Do you get people excited about it?

## The research proposal

In a short document, you give your supervisor a clear description of your research question and the research you want do. Although short, this proposal can be most intense and important part of your whole thesis; it is basically the core of your research. Some tips on what you have to include are:

- Clearly articulate how your research question will contriubte to the field. Check the previous section for tips on this. 
- Think about the methodology you will use already. Also try to find data sources you can use. 
- Do a literature review. This does not need to be the final version, but identify key works relevant to your research. 

## Invest in skills beforehand

### Coding skills

Chances are this will be the biggest independent coding project you have done so far in the course of your studies. Investing in these skills before starting the thesis can ease the workload during the thesis writing process. This includes familiarizing yourself with the software programs you will use and developing skills for data preparation. Also revising your knowledge on model estimation etc. can be done beforehand. 

The following resources on the Tilburg Science Hub's website and beyond can help you with that:

#### For programming languages:
- [Getting started with stata](/learn/stata): Tutorial for coding in stata
- [Getting started with R](/learn/r): Tutorial for coding in R
- [Learn Python and Julia](/learn-python-and-julia/): A bundle of great resources for getting started with Python and Julia. 

#### Learn LaTex
- [Tutorial on Latex](/what-is-latex/): LaTex is a typesetting system ideal for academic documents, like your thesis, enabling precise formatting and presentation.

#### Other skills
- [Use ChatGPT for your research](/chat-gpt-research/)
- [Web scraping and API Mining tutorial](/web-scraping-tutorial/): A tutorial that shows you how to scrape static and dynamic websites and how to extract data from APIs.

## Some general tips

### Communication with your supervisor

- Prepare for meetings: have a list of topics you want to discuss to make an efficient meeting and ensure you are not missing critical points. 
- Ideally, have new progress on your thesis before every meeting, recognizing that opportunities for direct interaction with your supervisor may be restricted.
- Take responsibility of your progress and preparation for each meeting, as this is mainly your project and not your supervisor's. 

### Mental health

Writing a thesis can be stressful. Unexpected problems may arise, related or unrelated to your thesis project. Generally, it is good to address any arising issues early with your supervisor. This allows you to come up with a solution together, by for example narrowing down the scope of your thesis. 

If necessary, the program coordinator can provide you with an official extension of your deadline, if facing delays due to special circumstances.

#### Mental health tips

- Follow your own pace and avoid comparing your progress to others
- Acknowledge that ups and downs are normal and inevitable
- Stay active in hobbies and activities that recharge you. Enough recharging will also make you more productive when working on your thesis!
- While being ambitious is good, also set expectations and realize that your thesis most likely will not single-handedly change the world. 
- Interact with fellow students for mutual support
