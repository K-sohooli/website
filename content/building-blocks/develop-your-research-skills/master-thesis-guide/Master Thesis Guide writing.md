## Academic writing 

Writing your thesis requires effective communication through academic writing. Here are some essential tips:

- Divide your work into manageable sections and set yourself (realistic!) deadlines for each section.
- Use an active voice
- Keep sentences short and easy to read.
- Communicate in simple language: your reader - someone that has a general education in your field but might not be an expert on the topic - should be able to understand your text easily. 
- Pay attention to spelling, using tools such as [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/). 

- seek feedback from peers during the writing process. [The Scriptorium](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/writing-information-skills/scriptorium) is also a great place to go for free of charge assistance in the writing process your thesis.

## LaTeX
LaTeX is a typesetting system ideal for your thesis. Although it has a bit of learning curve, it offers substantial advantages like:

- It enables more precise formatting, especially in typesetting mathematical symbols and formulas.
- It is easy to stay consistent with the formatting through the whole document. 
- It can automatically update citations and cross-references with document structure changes. 

Download a [ready-to-use LaTeX template for your thesis](/write-your-paper/latex-templates/)!

And if you are new to LaTeX, [our tutorial](/write-your-first-latex-document/what-is-latex/) will teach you how to write your first LaTeX document in 15 minutes.

## Formatting your paper

Adhering to the official formatting guidelines your thesis is crucial. Pay attention to details!
Some general tips are:
- Use page numbers, with the same font as your text
- Be consistent in page settings over the whole document

### Format of tables and figures
- There are packages available that format or combine output of your statistical analyses (e.g. `stargazer` in R, and [`kableextra`](/regressions/kableextra/)
- Tables and figures need to be clear enough to be understood without reading the main text! 
- Use a descriptive title that summarizes the main point ("X increases Y") rather than using a generic title ("Results")
- Give variables and figure axes clear names
- Avoid colors in figures
- Always refer back to tables and figures in the text
- Only the equations that are referred back to in the text need to be numbered

## References

Use tools for referencing that can automatically update your references when something. However, don't rely on them completely and still check the accuracy yourself.

[Mendeley Reference Manager](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager) is such a tool that helps you store and organize all your references. 
- When using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), you can import your Mendeley references library into your Overleaf project. Within Overleaf, you can refresh this .bib file after updates are made within Mendeley. 
- When using Word, you can use Mendeley Cite as citation add-in for inserting referencing from your Mendeley library into your Word document. 

EndNote is another reference management tool, which you can integrate with Word. Students at Tilburg University can install EndNote via [the self-service portal of IT](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/scriptorium/sources/endnote).
