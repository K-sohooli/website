# What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that's inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, particularly in how it processes information and learns from it. It's called "deep" learning because it involves neural networks with many layersâ€”these are the "deep" part. Each layer of these networks learns to transform the data in a way that makes it more useful for achieving the network's overall goal.

Deep learning is commonly used in image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition tasks. It finds applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, where it enables tasks like medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and autonomous driving.

## Inspiration from the human brain

As has been described in the section above, the inspiration actually comes from the human brain structure. Let's take a look at the human brain neuron anatomy.

During his groundbreaking research on neural networks, Geoffrey Hinton posed a crucial question: could we develop computer algorithms that emulate the behavior of neurons in the brain? The aspiration was to replicate the brain's structure in order to harness some of its capabilities. 

In pursuit of this goal, researchers examined the behavior of neurons within the brain. A key insight emerged: a single neuron lacks utility on its own; rather, functional significance arises from networks of neurons working together.

This results from the nature of neurons, which operate by transmitting signals. Specifically, dendrites of neurons receive signals and transmit them along the axon.

### How neurons forward the information?
An actual neuron fires an output signal only when the total strength of the input signals exceed a certain threshold. This
phenomenon is modeled in the perceptron by calculating the weighted sum of the inputs and applying a step or activation function (which are going to be explained later in this article).

How can the aforementioned structure of neurons be mimicked by computers? Let's consider the architecture below:

Weights play a crucial role in deep learning as they are pivotal in training models. The adjustment of weights constitutes the primary method of training deep learning models, a concept that will become evident as we proceed to construct to the architecture of deep neural networks.

After a neuron gathers inputs from preceding layer neurons, it computes the sum of each signal multiplied by its respective weight. Subsequently, these computed values are transmitted to an activation function, as demonstrated below:

# Shallow and deep neural networks

Neural networks could be distinguished between shallow and deep neural networks. What is the difference?

Single-layer neural networks, also referred to as shallow neural networks, comprise a single hidden layer positioned between the input and output layers. This hidden layer conducts computations, orchestrating the transformation of input data to yield the intended output. Shallow neural networks, though straightforward, possess restricted capacity for learning intricate patterns and representations.

In contrast, deep neural networks boast multiple hidden layers distributed between the input and output layers. These networks can be profoundly deep, incorporating tens or even hundreds of layers. Each layer undertakes computations, forwarding the modified data to the subsequent layer in succession.

# Components of deep learning network
In the sections above we introduced concept of deep learning and we talked a little bit about biology behind it. Let's move now to explaining separate components of deep learning architecture.

- **Input layer** refers to the first layer of nodes in an artificial neural network. This layer receives input data from the outside world.

- **Hidden layers** are what make neural networks "deep" and enable them to learn complex data representations.

- **Output layer** is the final layer in the neural network where desired predictions are obtained. There is one output layer in a neural network that produces the desired final prediction.

## How information is transferred between the layers?

In neural networks, information is transferred between layers through weighted connections. Each neuron in a layer receives input from neurons in the previous layer, multiplies these inputs by corresponding weights, sums them up, and applies an activation function to produce an output. This output becomes the input for neurons in the next layer, and the process repeats for each layer until reaching the output layer. 

## Loss function
The loss function in deep learning measures how well the model's predictions match the actual targets in the training data. It quantifies the difference between predicted and true values, providing feedback for adjusting the model's parameters during training. The goal is to minimize the loss function, indicating better alignment between predictions and actual outcomes, ultimately improving the model's performance. 

Mathematically speaking the loss function is the chosen family of mathematical equations which returns a scalar that is smaller when the model maps inputs to outputs better. 

$L[\theta, f[x, \theta],$
{{<katex>}}  
\{ x_{i}, y_{i} \}^{I}_{i=1}
{{</katex>}}
$]$


where:

$ f[x, \theta] $ is a deep learning model

{{<katex>}}  
\{ x_{i}, y_{i} \}^{I}_{i=1}
{{</katex>}} is a training data

## Training process
Let us denote our training dataset of I pairs of input/output examples:


$\text{Training Data: }$ {{<katex>}}\{ x_{i}, y_{i} \}^{I}_{i=1}{{</katex>}}

Training consists in finding the model's parameters to minimize the loss function, i.e:

$\hat{\theta} = argmin[L[\theta, f[x, \theta], \{ [x_{i}, y_{i}] \}^{I}_{i=1}]]$

A single prediction $\hat{y}$ can be denoted in the following way:

$\hat{y} = f[x, \hat{\theta}]$

## Activation function
Activation functions are essential components of neural networks as they introduce nonlinearity, a crucial element for enabling the development of intricate representations and functions. This nonlinearity expands the network's capacity to capture complex relationships and patterns from the inputs, surpassing the capabilities of a basic linear regression model.

Multiple options are available for the choice of the activation function:

- Sigmoid function (only used in the output layer of the logistic regression):
$ a(z) =  \frac{\mathrm{1} }{\mathrm{1} + e^-{z} }  $ 

- Tanh function:
$ a(z) = \frac{e^{z} - e^{-z}}{e^{z} + e^{-z}} $

- ReLU function:
$ a(z) = \max\(0,z)$

## Mathematical representation
After introducing all necessary concepts, lets take a look how layers are represented mathematically:
First let's consider very small neural network which has only 2 hidden layers:

 $\small \text{Inputs: }$ {{<katex>}}\{ x_{i} \}^{I}_{i=1}{{</katex>}}

$ \small \text{$1st$ hidden layer: } h_{0} = a[\beta_{0} + \Omega_{0}x] $ 

$ \small \text{$2nd$ hidden layer: } h_{1} = a[\beta_{1} + \Omega_{1}h1]$

$ \small \text{Output layer: } y =  \beta_{2} + \Omega_{2}h_{2} $

This small neural network, mathematically would be denoted in the following way:

<center> $y = \beta_{2} + \Omega_{2}a[\beta_{1} + \Omega_{1}a[\beta_{0} + \Omega_{0}x]]$ </center> <br/>

Moving now to more general formula with k number of hidden layers.

$ \small \text{Inputs: }$ {{<katex>}}\{ x_{i} \}^{I}_{i=1}{{</katex>}}

$ \small \text{$kth$ hidden layer: } h_{k} = a[\beta_{k-1} + \Omega_{k-1}h_{k-1}] $

$ \small \text{Output layer: } y =  \beta_{k} + \Omega_{k}h_{k} $

where: 
- $a$ is an activation function
- $\beta$ is bias vector (biases: additional parameters added to the weighted sum before applying the activation function)
- $\Omega$ is a weight matrix (grid-like structure containing numerical values. Each value in the matrix represents the strength of a connection between neurons in one layer and neurons in the next layer of a neural network.)

Finally the general equation of the deep neural network could be annotated as following:

<center> $y = \beta_{k} th+ \Omega_{k}a[\beta_{k-1} + \Omega_{k-1}a[...\beta_{2} + \Omega_{2}a[...\beta_{1} + \Omega_{1}]]...]]$ </center>

## Coding deep neural network

Coding deep neural networks involves using programming languages such as Python, which is highly popular due to its simplicity and extensive libraries for machine learning and neural networks. Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch are widely used for building and training deep neural networks, providing high-level APIs for constructing complex architectures with ease. 

The code snippet below imports necessary libraries for building and training a neural network using Keras with the MNIST dataset. It preprocesses the data, constructs a sequential model with dense layers, compiles the model, trains it on the training data, and evaluates its performance on the test data, printing out the test loss and accuracy.

```
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load the MNIST dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
X_train = X_train.reshape((X_train.shape[0], -1)).astype('float32') / 255
X_test = X_test.reshape((X_test.shape[0], -1)).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = to_categorical(y_train)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test)

# Creating a Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Adding layers to the model
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))

# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=128, verbose=1, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluating the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print("Test Loss:", loss)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)

```
