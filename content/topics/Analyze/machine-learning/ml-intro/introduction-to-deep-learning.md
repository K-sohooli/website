# What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is an evolution of Neural Networks, with more layers/modules

• Deep Learning generates non-linear, hierarchical representations, progressively transforming data into more abstract forms with each layer.

• Deep learning models are capable of adapting to diverse input/output formats and sizes, ranging from images to intricate language structures.

### Inspiration from the human brain

• The inspiration comes actually from the human brain structure
