# Overview

The ability to process and analyze text data is increasingly important in the era of big data. From social media analytics to customer feedback analysis, the insights gained from text data can inform decision-making and reveal trends. However, raw text data is often messy and unstructured. Preprocessing this data into a clean format is essential for effective analysis.

This tutorial introduces the fundamental techniques of text preprocessing in Python, utilizing the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for data manipulation, [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for tokenization and lemmatization, and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with some fundamental skills to prepare text data for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project.
